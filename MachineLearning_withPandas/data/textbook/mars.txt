Description: Temperature profile of the Martian atmosphere, as
measured by the Mars Global Surveyor spacefcraft in 2003 using a radio
occultation technique. Data include the altitude (measured as
from the center of the planet) and atmospheric temperature (K).

Variable labels: radius = plantocentric radius (km)
                 temperature (K)
                 sigmatemperature = 1 standard deviation of the temperature
