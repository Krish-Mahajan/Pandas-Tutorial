Description: Records of crude oil spills of at least 1000 barrels from
tankers in US waters during 1974-1999.  For each year, the data
indicate the number of spills, the estimated amount of oil shipped
through US waters as part of US import/export operations (adjusted for
spillage in international or foreign waters), and the amount of oil
shipped through US waters during domestic shipments.  Oil shipments
are measured in billions of barrels of oil (Bbbl).

Variable labels: year, spills, importexport, domestic
