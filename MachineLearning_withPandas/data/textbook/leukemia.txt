6-{M}ercaptopurine on the duraction of steriod-induced  remissions
in acute leukemia: A model for evaluation fo other potentially
useful therapy.  Blood, 21(6): 699-716.

Description: Remission times for patients suffering from acute
leukemia and receiving either 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or a placebo.
One year after the start of the study, the length (weeks)
of the remission period for each patient was recorded.
Some outcomes were censored because remission extended beyond the
study period.
