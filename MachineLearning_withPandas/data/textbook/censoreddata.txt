These data are used in the book "Computational Statistics" 
by G.H. Givens and J.A. Hoeting.

Name: censoreddata.dat
Chapter: 4
Discussed in: Example 4.7

Description: Terminology for this example is introduced in Example
4.5.  Let Yi ~ Exp(lambda) i.i.d. for i=1,...,30.  Let ci denote
constants for i=1,...,30.  The observed data are
Xi=(min(Yi,ci),deltai) where deltai=1 if Yi<=ci and deltai=0 if
Yi>ci.  Thus deltai=0 corresponds to right censoring.  Since these
data were simulated, we include Yi, ci, and Xi, although Xi alone
constitutes the observed data.

Variable labels: Yi, ci, obsvi (=min(Yi,ci)), deltai
