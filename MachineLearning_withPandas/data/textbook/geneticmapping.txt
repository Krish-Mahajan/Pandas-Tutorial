Name: geneticmapping.dat
Chapter: 3
Discussed in: Problems 3.5, 3.6

Description: 100 chromosomes (rows) consisting of 12 loci (columns).
The source parent for the allele at each locus is denoted with a zero
or one.  (These data are simulated, and the permutation of the observed
loci that corresponds to the ordering used to generate the data is
2,4,12,6,3,7,1,11,9,8,5,10.  In other words, loci 2 and 10 are located
at opposite ends of the chromosome.)

Variable labels: loc1, loc2, loc3, loc4, loc5, loc6, loc7, loc8, loc9,
loc10, loc11, loc12
