Name: serviceberry.dat
Chapter: 8
Discussed in: Example 8.6,  8.7, and 8.9

Source: Derived from data obtained from E. L. Little, Jr. (1976),
  "Atlas of United States Trees, Minor Western Hardwoods", US
  Department of Agriculture, vol 3, Miscellaneous Publication 1314

Description: The data indicate presence (1) and absence (0) of the
  Utah serviceberry in a region of western Colorado (west of
  approximately 104 degrees W longitude).  We binned the GIS 
  presence/absence information into pixels that are approximately 8 km
  by 8 km.  This grid consists of a lattice of 46 by 54 pixels giving
  a total of 2,484 pixels.  If you read in these data into R and
  name the variable "y", the R commands:

  par(pty="s")
  image(1:54,46:1,matrix(y,54,46))

  should produce a picture similar to the left panel in Figure 8.5.

Variable labels: none
