Description: Infrared emissions and other characteristics of objects
beyond our galaxy.  We have included some additional data not
mentioned in the book, just for fun.

Variable labels:
RAh = hour of right ascension
RAm = minute of right ascension
RAs = second of right ascension
DEd = degree of declination
DEm = arcminute of declination
DEs = arcsecond of declination
GLON = galactic longitude
GLAT = galactic latitude
F12 = total 12 micron band flux density
F25 = total 25 micron band flux density
F60 = total 60 micron band flux density
F100 = total 100 micron band flux density
CZ = heliocentric radial velocity
D = estimated source distance
