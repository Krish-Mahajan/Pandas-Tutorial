Description: Times to recurrence for breast cancer patients receiving
a hormone treatment.  Women who did not have a recurrence before the
end of the clinical trial have right censored data (censored=1)
because their time to recurrence is known to exceed the given value
(recurtime).  Treatment=1 corresponds to the hormone treatment group
and treatment=0 corresponds to the control group.

Variable labels: recurtime, treatment, censored
