    "The goal of this problem is to investigate the role of the proposal distribution in a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm designed to simulate from the posterior distribution of the mixture parameter $\\delta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate 200 realizations from the mixture distribution:\n",
    "    $$y_i \\sim \\delta N(7, 0.5^2) + (1-\\delta) N(10, 0.5^2)$$\n",
    "    with $\\delta = 0.7$. Plot a histogram of these data. \n",
    "2. Implement an ABC procedure to simulate from the posterior distribution of $\\delta$, using your data from part (1). \n",
    "3. Implement a random walk M-H algorithm with proposal $\\delta^{\\prime} = \\delta^{(i)} + \\epsilon$ with $\\epsilon \\sim Unif(−1,1)$. \n",
    "4. Reparameterize the problem letting $U = \\log\\left[\\frac{\\delta}{1 - \\delta}\\right]$ and $u^{\\prime} = u^{(i)} + \\epsilon$. Implement a random walk chain in U-space. \n",
    "5. Compare the estimates and convergence behavior of the three algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part (1), you are asked to simulate data from a distribution with $\\delta$ known. For parts (2)–(4), assume $\\delta$ is unknown with prior $\\delta \\sim Unif( 0,1)$. For parts (2)–(4), provide an appropriate plot and a table summarizing the output of the algorithm. To facilitate comparisons, use the same number of iterations, random seed, starting values, and burn-in period for all implementations of the algorithm. "
